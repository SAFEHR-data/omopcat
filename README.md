The goal of calypso is to provide a summary of OMOP data and display it in a public data catalogue

## Installation

You can install the development version of calypso from within R like so:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("SAFEHR-data/calypso")
```

## Development

### Set up

Make sure you have a [recent version of R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (>= 4.0.0) installed.
Though not required, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is recommended as an IDE,
as it has good support for R package development and Shiny.

1. Clone this repository

    - Either with `git clone git@github.com:SAFEHR-data/omop-data-catalogue.git`
    - Or by creating [a new project in RStudio from version control](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/version-control.html#creating-a-new-project-based-on-a-remote-git-or-subversion-repository)

2. Install [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) and restore the project library by running the following from an R console in the project directory:

    ```r
    install.packages("renv")
    renv::restore()
    ```
3. Create the [duckdb](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb) test database and run the analyses by running from an R console in the project directory:

    ```r
    source(here::here("scripts/create_dev_data.R"))
    ```

4. To preview the app locally, run the following from an R console within the project directory:

    ```r
    golem::run_dev()
    ```

The `dev/02_dev.R` script contains a few helper functions to get you started.

The test data can be found in [`inst/dev_data`](https://github.com/SAFEHR-data/omop-data-catalogue/tree/main/inst/data). These data have been generated by using the synthetic dataset '[synthea-allergies-10k](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CDMConnector/reference/eunomiaDir.html)', and adding some [dummy data](https://github.com/SAFEHR-data/omop-data-catalogue/tree/main/dev/test_db/dummy) for the MEASUREMENT and OBSERVATION tables (to have some records in the 'calypso-summary-stats' table).

5. Configure the "low-frequency statistics masking" feature, by defining a threshold and a replacement value (values below the threshold will be replaced, in the summary statistics), as environment variables:

- `LOW_FREQUENCY_THRESHOLD`
- `LOW_FREQUENCY_REPLACEMENT`

### File structure

This repo is organised as an R package with a few additional directories used for deployment of the
Shiny app:

- `R/`: contains the R source code for the package
- `inst/`: configuration files and dummy data for the app
    - `dev_data/`: dummy data for the app to use during development
    - `app/wwww`: static files (e.g. CSS, JavaScript) for the app
- `man/`: documentation files for the package, generated by `{roxygen2}`
- `tests/`: unit tests for the package, written with `{testthat}`

The directories _not_ included in the package (i.e. listed in `.Rbuildignore`) but used for deployment and data pre-processing:

- `data-raw/test_db`: the source data for generating the test data
- `data/test_data`: test data parquet files mimicking what real data would look like to run the app in production
- `dev/`: contains scripts and helper functions for development
- `deploy/`: contains Docker files and scripts for deployment
- `renv/`: contains the `renv` library, managed by `{renv}`
- `scripts/`: contains scripts for data pre-processing and generating the test and dev data

### Updating the `renv` lockfile

Make sure to regularly run `renv::status(dev = TRUE)` to check if your local library and the lockfile
are up to date.

When adding a new dependency, install it in the `renv` library with

```r
renv::install("package_name")
```

and then use it in your code as usual.
`renv` will pick up the new package if it's installed and used in the project.

To update the lockfile, run

```r
renv::snapshot(dev = TRUE)
```

The `dev = TRUE` argument ensures that development dependencies (e.g. those recorded under
`Suggests` in the `DESCRIPTION` file) are also included in the lockfile.
 
### Design

The Shiny app is developed using the [`{golem}`](https://engineering-shiny.org/golem.html) framework.
Among other things, this means that we make heavy use of [Shiny modules](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html).
In brief, a Shiny module is a self-contained, encapsulated piece of Shiny UI and server logic.
In practice, this will often be a particular component of the dashboard.
Note that it is possible to nest modules within other modules, leading to a hierarchical structure.

The filenames in `R/` follow the [`{golem}` conventions](https://engineering-shiny.org/golem.html#understanding-golem-app-structure):

* The `app_*.R` files define the UI and server logic for the app itself.
* The `mod_*.R` files define the UI and server logic for the modules.
* Any business logic functions, which are independent from the app's application logic, are defined in the `fct_*.R` files.

An overview of the app's design is given in the diagram below (note that this is subject to change):

### Coding style

We'll mainly follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
The [`{styler}`](https://styler.r-lib.org/index.html) package can be used to automatically format R code to this style,
by regularly running

```r
styler::style_pkg()
```

within the project directory.
It's also recommended to install [`{lintr}`](https://github.com/r-lib/lintr) and regularly run

```r
lintr::lint_package()
```

(or have it [run automatically in your IDE](https://lintr.r-lib.org/articles/editors.html)).

## Deployment

See the [deployment docs](./deploy/README.md).
